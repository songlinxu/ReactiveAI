# ReactiveAI: Modelling human logical reasoning process in dynamic environmental stress with cognitive agents

## Note

- Please do not forget to install the necessary libraries to run each file.
- We recommend to use python virtual environments like venv.

## Steps to replicate figures in the paper

- Download RL model weights from OSF (https://osf.io/nrxy4/), rename the downloaded folder as "results" and put it into the "rl_model" folder in this Github repo
- Double-check one example folder path if you make the correct path: ReactiveAI-main/rl_model/results/DRL_DDM_Fine_0.01.
- Go to "ReactiveAI-main/paper_plot" folder and make it your current path
- Run python figure_plot.py to draw all figures
- You could comment main codes to draw different figures in figure_plot.py. More details are in this file. 

## Steps to train the model from beginning
